# Amazon Web Scraping using Python

In this project, imported Python's powerful libraries to extract and track product data from Amazon, enabling automated price monitoring and alert notifications.

## Libraries Used:

- #### Pandas for data manipulation and storage
- #### Requests for HTTP requests to Amazon's website
- #### Beautiful Soup for HTML parsing and data extraction
- #### SMTPlib for email notifications
- #### Time and Datetime for scheduling and timestamping

## Project Features:

1. ***Web Scraping:*** Connects to Amazon's website, extracts relevant product data, and stores it in a structured format.

2. ***Timestamping:*** Creates a timestamp for each data pull, enabling tracking of data collection times.

3. ***CSV File Management:*** Creates and appends data to a CSV file within Jupyter Notebook, allowing for seamless data storage and analysis.

4. ***Scheduled Price Checks:*** Runs periodic price checks at set intervals, updating the CSV file with fresh data.

5. ***Conditional Email Alerts:*** Triggers email notifications via SMTPlib when predefined price conditions are met, ensuring timely alerts for price drops or increases.

## Technical Skills Demonstrated:

- Web scraping with Beautiful Soup and Requests
- Data manipulation and storage with Pandas
- Automation and scheduling with Time and Datetime
- Email integration with SMTPlib
- Jupyter Notebook for interactive development and analysis
